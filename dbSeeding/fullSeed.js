Good soil is rich in humus which comes from decaying organic compost. It is loose and fluffy, holds moisture, drains well, and has plenty of minerals essential for plant growth. Living organisms like earthworms, certain fungi, and bacteria also help maintain the quality of the soil.", "Finding the right fertilizer for your soil is another important aspect. Macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, magnesium, calcium, sulfur are important to plant health. Micronutrients like boron, iron, zinc, etc are also important, in smaller quantities, to the health of your plants. A good balance together not only assure healthy growth, but they also help your plants fight off pests and diseases.", "The final touch for the perfect soil composition is proper pH. Although other aspects such as soil nutrients are largely important, soil pH still plays its part. A good way to test soil pH is to mix some soil with distilled water in a container until muddy, and then add vinegar. If it fizzes then your soil is too acidic. If that is the case, adding some pulverized limestone, which has magnesium and calcium carbonate, will raise the pH of your soil. Usually the natural pH of soil is between 6-7, so you should not have to worry.", "Always remember, a great way to keep your garden soil rich is by adding organic compost. Things like grass clippings, leaves, plants trimmings, table scraps, etc are excellent use for compost. These items contain various amounts of micronutrients, and their use in compost guarantees returning those micronutrients to the soil."],
