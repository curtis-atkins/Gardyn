        "Water": "Water intensively once a week",
        "Special": "Beans generally don't need extra nitrogen for good growth because the beneficial bacteria that live in nodules on bean roots help to provide nitrogen for the plants. To speed up growth, give beans—particularly long-bearing pole beans or heavy-feeding limas—a midseason side-dressing of compost or kelp extract solution.",

        "Support": "No requirements",

        "Water": "Water regularly",
        "Special": "Brussels sprouts also need more boron than most other vegetables. If your brussels sprouts develop hollow stems and small buds, you can add boron to the soil by dissolving 1 level tablespoon of borax in 5 quarts of water and sprinkling it evenly over 50 square feet of bed.
